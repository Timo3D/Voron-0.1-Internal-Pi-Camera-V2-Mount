# Voron-0.1-Internal-Pi-Camera-V2-Mount
I haven't done extensive testing to see if the cam can survive in a heated enclosure for prolonged periods of time. Use at own risk!  

Parts required:  
2x M2x6 Screws  
2x M2 Nuts  
Pi Cam V2  
50cm Camera Cable  

If you use NoDropNuts to mount your Z linear rail stops, use the NoDropNut version. It's 2mm shorter than the original to account for the offset. Otherwise, use the normal one.
